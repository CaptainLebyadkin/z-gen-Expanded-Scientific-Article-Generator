Title: 
'z-gen' Article Generator

Description:
The robust, relevant, juicy and humorously functional interdisciplinary science article generator, "z-gen", combines the best parts of SCIgen and Mathgen, adding ever-volatile random rolls, in accordance with the ethos of the original author's intention- for the aid of amusement rather than strict believability (although, if you read a genuine government report, with its trendy-smarmy buzzwords, and happy and meaningless pictures and graphs, and overall bankruptcy of content, meaning, and sorts of honourable things sensible people care about, the line is actually really shockingly, scarily thin though, isn't it.)

This code was originally designed as an emergency bureaucracy-defence so that, if pressed (though I have never done this), I could attach an inappropriately long and entirely science-hogwash-sounding document to forms I might have to submit that require inordinately unnecessary and blatantly interfering administrative progress reports that no one would ever bother to read (but I wish they would try- I would enjoy that very much); but this code has now been put 'out to pasture' for the general public. 

Amaze and repulse your friends and family with this exciting package of *highly* meaningful corporate nounisms, exasperating facile manageability, and paradigm-shifting incorporativity (sic) all couched cleverly in context with the out-of-date work in the key topic area of *your (or its) choice*. Catch it quick before it is buried under a heap of other people's unsuccessful grant applications and inferior quality doctoral theses, sadly misfiled, and long forgotten by the important and sexy funny people of the department.
Disclaimer: occasional wildly inappropriate sarcastic side-comments, overtly heavy handed but inconsistent candidness and contemptuous and disdainful undertones may be present* in z-gen's output. 
Nevertheless, words that are 'too funny' can easily be replaced with your own respected field's special and exclusive index of corporate-wank terminology. My only wish is that I could add more contempt to it. 

'The problems of the world, ultimately, come down to a lack of nouns. Do your part, and buy a new noun for a friend you love.'
